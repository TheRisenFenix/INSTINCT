\section node_guide_introduction_preface Preface
Nodes are the major part of \ref introduction_fbp_instinct. These C++ objects perform different tasks, including reading/logging data and processing them.

\section node_guide_introduction_add_nodes Adding Nodes
As described in the \ref getting_started, a Node can be placed in the \ref work_space via **right-click** in the Workspace and select the wanted.
They can be moved around by **drag-and-drop**.

\section node_guide_introduction_context Context Menu
To open the Context Menu, **right-click** the Node. It provides information and interaction details regarding the selected Node. These include:
<img src="nodesContextMenu.png" align="right">
  1. **ID** : The Nodes individual ID (different for each Node, even for multiple Nodes of the same type)
  2. **Type** : The type/name of the node, indicating its purpose
  3. **Kind** : Relevant for developers (in most cases: *blueprint*)
  4. **Inputs** : Number of input-Pins the Node has
  5. **Outputs** : Number of output-Pins the Node has
  6. **State** : State of the Node (*Deinitialized, Initialized, Disabled*)
  7. **Mode** : Mode the Node is running in (default: *Real-time*)
  8. **Initialize** : Initialize (only) the Node
    - **Reinitialize** : Reinitialize the Node if it is initialized before
  9. **Deinitialize** : Deinitialize (only) the Node
  10. **Wake worker** : Wakes the worker if it went to sleep (not relevant for basic users)
  11. **Configure** : Opens the \ref node_guide_introduction_settings
  12. **Disable** : Disables the Node; Node will be ignored in the Flow
  13. **Rename** : Change the Nodes name - does not change the name displayed under *3. kind*
  14. **Delete** : Removes the Node

\section node_guide_introduction_settings Node Settings
By clicking the *Configure* button in the Context Menu, or **double-(left)click** on a Node, the Settings open. Here, necessary configurations have to be made, as described in \ref working_with_instinct . Examples are:
- Choose the file to read (Data Provider Nodes)
- Choose the method, parameters etc. for a calculation (Data Processor Nodes)
- Choose the name/folder for the file to store (Data Logger Nodes)

The Settings are individual for every Node depending on her purpose.

\section node_guide_introduction_connect Connect Nodes
Nodes have Pins that need to be connected to other Nodes in order to build a working Flow. More about the types and how connecting them works can be found in \ref node_connections .

\section node_guide_introduction_nodes List of Nodes
For a list of all available Nodes, their Settings and examples, follow \ref node_guide_landing_page .
